This Project is created according to Sharpe AI internship's assignment requirements.This project is made using React and JS.


There are 3 pages in the application , In the Home page , We can generate random Quotes. In transaction page , we can provide a valid Ethereum Address and amount and send a request to store the data in Goggle firebase. I have used react-hook-form instead of traditional form due to its state management ease.Ethereus address is validated using Ether.js. In Data Page, all the data retrieved from Firebase database is showed.I have created a responsive design for the application.


This Project has taught me some new things also. I used Firebase for the first time, it was little challenging. Also One major issue I faced was with the Quotes API.According to the API Doc, I was making the correct request , but the connection was not secure , had to chance the API from https to http . It worked but during deploying , it failed.


I have handled the errors where it was possible , wrote the code in try and catch blocks.
